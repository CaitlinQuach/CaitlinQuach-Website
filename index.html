        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I graduated in the summer of 2021 from Milpitas High School after attending the school for four years, three of those years being part of the Digital Business Academy, or DBA. In DBA, the students are exposed to different jobs and experience mock interviews and learn practical skills such as Excel, Word, and even a bit of HTML in preparation for the job-hunting world. The academy also includes meeting speakers from different jobs and learning about them in order to solidify their decision on their career choice in the future. Field trips are conducted to different colleges so the students become familiar with different campuses in order to broaden their options. From that academy, I have become familiar with the job hunting process and fairly proficient in Excel and Microsoft Word. During high school, I also took classes such as AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, English 1A, English 1B, Honors English, and Honors Chemistry. My overall GPA during high school was around a 3.8 or 3.9.<br><br>

        As a result of doing community service to help fund the Milpitas High School Debate Club, I became accustomed to handling money and making quick calculations in order to determine the amount needed and the change from distributing the snacks meant to be sold to the attendees. Due to the location, which was in a cafeteria where all the contestants were residing before the competition, I am also used to focusing and making calculations in noisy environments where many different discussions and conversations could derail my thought process. Furthermore, sometimes I help my parents with the calculations in regards to Vietnamese New Years' red envelopes and the Target Gift Cards for Christmas, thus making me a bit more familiar with calculations on a smaller scale. <br><br>

        During the summer of 2019, I volunteered to help at my high school, which was Milpitas High School, to sort and label the textbooks and books set to be used the following year. By helping out, I have become familiar with organizing and taking inventory of the required materials needed for the following school year. The work was not just limited to sitting down to count and label textbooks, it also had me determine which materials went to which classroom thus requiring me to find the best way to transfer books to their classrooms and where to stack them as the classrooms were often cluttered in preparation for the following school year. This was also useful when planning the system and work to be done for a plant nursery I also volunteered at where I worked with others to plant saplings and mixing the soil for the nursery.
